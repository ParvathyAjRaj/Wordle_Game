Project Name : Wordle

Description : I tried to recreate the Worlde Game.
              Here a secret word will be the answer each time you reload. By guessing the words you can identify if 
              any of the letters in your guessed word matches the right word.
              There is only 5 chances to guess, if you find out the answer within this number of chance, you "WON"!
              If not then the right answer will be shown in an alert box.
              
<hr>Case 1 => If any letter of your guessed word is present in answer and also the right position is figured out, then
that particular block will be having green background colour.<br>
Case 2 => If any letter of your guessed word is present in answer, but you haven't figured out the right position, 
then that particular block will be having yellow background colour.<br>
Case 3 => Rest will be having gray background colour.
